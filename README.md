# Packer Plugin Example

This is a multi-plugin example built with real plugins. Even though this is a fully functional plugin,
this is not supposed to be used in real scenarios and should be used as a source of information on how 
multi-plugins are built.

To use the plugins from this example in real environments, please refer to the following:
